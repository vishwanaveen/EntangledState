# Quantum Entanglement and Entangled States

Quantum entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum mechanics where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the state of the other particle(s). This correlation persists even when the particles are far apart, defying classical notions of locality.

## Entangled States

In quantum mechanics, the state of a particle is described by a wave function. When two or more particles are entangled, their wave functions are combined into a single, entangled state. This entangled state cannot be written as a simple product of the individual states of the particles.

For example, let's consider a system of two entangled particles, often referred to as qubits. The general form of an entangled state can be written as:


Here, |0⟩ and |1⟩ represent the possible states of a single qubit, and α and β are complex probability amplitudes that determine the coefficients of the entangled state.

## Measuring Entangled States

When we measure an entangled system, the measurement outcomes of the individual particles are correlated. For instance, if we measure the first particle and obtain a result of |0⟩, the state of the second particle collapses into the corresponding state that is entangled with |0⟩.

It's important to note that the measurement outcomes are probabilistic. The entangled state only provides probabilities for different measurement outcomes, and the actual result is determined when the measurement is performed.

## Applications of Quantum Entanglement

Quantum entanglement has profound implications for various fields, including:

1. **Quantum Computing:** Entangled states can be used to perform certain computations more efficiently than classical computers, enabling breakthroughs in cryptography, optimization, and simulation.
2. **Quantum Teleportation:** By utilizing entanglement, it is possible to transmit the exact state of a particle to a distant location instantaneously, without physically moving the particle itself.
3. **Quantum Cryptography:** Entanglement can be used to create secure communication channels, as any attempt to eavesdrop on an entangled transmission would disturb the entanglement and be detectable.

## Conclusion

Quantum entanglement is a remarkable phenomenon that defies classical intuitions about the nature of reality. It forms the basis for numerous applications in quantum technology and continues to be a topic of intense research and exploration in the field of quantum mechanics.
