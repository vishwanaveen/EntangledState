# Quantum Entangled State Creation with Qiskit



Welcome to the Quantum Entangled State Creation with Qiskit project! This repository focuses on developing a codebase that utilizes the Qiskit framework to create various entangled quantum states. The project centers around the implementation of a versatile function called `create_entangled_state(Name_Entangled_State, Number_of_Qubits)`, which allows users to generate entangled states of their choice and receive the resulting quantum circuit as output.

## Features

- Utilizes Qiskit to construct quantum circuits that generate entangled states.
- `create_entangled_state()` function enables users to specify the desired entangled state and number of qubits.
- Returns a quantum circuit representing the requested entangled state.
- Supports creation of popular entangled states (e.g., Bell states, GHZ states) and user-defined states.
- Comprehensive documentation and code comments for easy understanding and integration.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Install Qiskit by referring to the official installation guide available at [https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html](https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html).
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantum-entangled-state-creation.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd quantum-entangled-state-creation`
4. Explore the code files and familiarize yourself with the entangled state creation logic.
5. Customize the `create_entangled_state()` function or introduce additional functions as needed.
6. Execute the code and observe the generated entangled states by experimenting with different inputs.

## Usage Example

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

def create_entangled_state(Name_Entangled_State, Number_of_Qubits):
    # Implementation logic for creating the specified entangled state using Qiskit
    
    # Return the created entangled state as a quantum circuit
    return entangled_state_circuit

# Example usage:
desired_state_name = "GHZ"  # Specify the desired entangled state, e.g., "GHZ" for a GHZ state
num_qubits = 3  # Specify the number of qubits, e.g., 3 qubits for a GHZ state

entangled_state = create_entangled_state(desired_state_name, num_qubits)
print("Entangled state circuit:")
print(entangled_state)
